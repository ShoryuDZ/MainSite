Education Content (Basic)

Education is of great importance to the entire nation. It determines how young people begin to interact with society and sets the tone for the future by informing the next generation of our values.

Unfortunately, Educational Inequality is at an all-time high, with some of the most disadvantaged students lacking access to resources. This has also caused a downturn in results, with Australia no longer performing at the top of the world, unlike during the mid 1980s.

Hence, educational circles should be putting effort towards trying to rectify this gap. After all, the idea of a fair go for all is engrained in Australian culture.

As someone with technical experience, and a communications background, my role within the education system is to expose to students on how they can apply a variety of skills in new ways, to further themselves and assist their communities.
