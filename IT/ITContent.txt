Information Technology has the power to change the way we live, making it easier to communicate with others, providing convenience to our tasks to free up our time, and sharing information to increase availability amongst many people and/or places. With such great social responsibility to create pieces of technology which provide benefits to all of society, rather than to a select few.

The technology sector, however, especially at the development level, lacks a sense of this social responsibility they owe as a result of being gifted the power to create. It is disappointing that some of our nation?s greatest minds dream only of working for large technological conglomerates, which consistently prove themselves to lack the best interests of the customers they serve. Even worse, a culture is emerging amongst young people to prioritise comfort in working conditions, even if that means working for organisations such as big banks, which maintain prominence & sustain their business model by working actively against the community.

Those with the skill and ability to program- that is, those with the skill and ability to create, should prioritise this skill in engineering and building software that, first and foremost, benefits its users and broader society. By building tools which assist some of the most valuable sectors within our community (e.g. Nursing, Education, Community Services etc.), the work these sectors do can be strengthened, and new ways of assisting others can be implemented.

Educational Technology is predicted to be one of Australia?s most valuable tech sub-sectors by 2030, as parents, schools and governments begin to realise its potential as an accessible and engaging format to teach our students. I aim to work in this sector, managing the creation of EdTech products which inspire students from all walks of life to educate themselves widely, and convincing both Educational and Technological circles about its potential capabilities.
