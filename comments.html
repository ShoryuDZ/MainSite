                <div class="commentcontent">This page has a neon-purple colour scheme, adapted from <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/neon-color-palettes">Shutterstock. </a> This is incorporated in all aspects of the page, including the tinting of images and the logo. I chose this scheme as it is straightforward in its application, and the colours are easy to apply on top of each other. As Paul Robert Lloyd refers to, "Everything old is new again," further inspiring my 80's theme neon designs. Unlike other colour schemes, it is also incredibly bright and makes the page look more dynamic. Even small additions, such as a brick background allow the colours to almost come out of the screen and scream vibrancy to the user. <br> <br> Furthermore, a set of fonts was chosen for this website: A Neon Font for the menu, and Rubrik for the content. These are both sans-serif fonts, and have a modern, sleek appeal, working well with the colour scheme for the rest of the website. </div>

The image below shows the hyperlink in 'index.html' in the 'public_html' directory leads to one HTML file called 'index.html' in a directory called 'websystems'. This 'index.html' is the home page of the website and has hyperlinks to 'index.html', 'past.html', 'future.html', and finally 'comments.html'. All of these webpages contain elements of CSS, from a file called 'websystems.css', which defines the User Interface and design throughout the website. </div>

                <span class="subtitle">ACESSIBLITY</span>
                There are numerous accessibility issues that frequently occur on webpages, as outlined by <a href="https://webaim.org/intro/">WebAIM (a web organisation with accessiblity in mind).</a> These have all been addressed in my website:
                <ul>
                    <li>Visual: Blindness, Colour-Blindness</li>
                    <li>Hearing: Deafness, Hard of Hearing</li>
                    <li>Motor: Low fine motor control, inability to use a mouse</li>
                    <li>Cognitive: Learning disabilities, distractibility</li>
                </ul>
                All these issues in accessiblity are addressed through the following mechanisms:
                <p id="accesslist">
                    &#10004; Alternative Text (those relying on a screen reader can interpret images) <br>
                    &#10004; Document Structure (all documents are logically structured to assist those with focus issues)<br>
                    &#10004; Headers for Tables (this is very helpful for screen readers)<br>
                    &#10004; Links make sense without context (not everyone follows the expected order of content engagement) <br>
                    &#10004; No Audio (those who have hearing difficulties are not missing out) <br>
                    &#10004; Colour doesn't convey meaning (the colour on this page exists only for aesthetic purposes) <br>
